Concerns
Using thread.sleep in the control packets could lead to exhuasting the threadpool. Dont spam control packets and stack them Only a problem if you send dozens of control packets all utilizing the revert after x number of seconds option.
JSON Size can be max of 246 characters in the plc. it will kick out a blank packet if its too large.
Maximum number of errors high at the same time currently is 5 ( its limited due to what i set Pairs to in the short time statistics and json encoder)
You shouldnt even aproach the maximum speed of the service. if you are running into a problem Logging can fall behind on higher levels. Disabling that may help.
Currently the Resource Manager does not check for if your inputs are Good quality.
Currently the SNP server does not comunicate out wether packets were successfull or not. for a udp type setup or one incapable of hearing back like the plc this is not a problem however it may become a problem for higher level applications.
Could change MQTT Implementation on PLC to allow for larger packets possibly.
UDP Input does not buffer through anything.
